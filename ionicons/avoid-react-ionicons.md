# Avoid react-ionicons

I gave it a whirl, but ran into a problem where I had to jump through hoops to style them as I wanted because they do not have `currentColor` set to "inherit" by default. 
There is a [PR to fix this](https://github.com/zamarrowski/react-ionicons/issues/69) but it has been sitting there unmerged for two years.
