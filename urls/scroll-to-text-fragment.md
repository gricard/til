# Scroll to Text Fragment

You can append `#:~:text=<my text>` to a URL to tell the browser to scroll to the first instance of that text on the page.

This is useful for pages that do not contain anchor tags to link someone to a specific section of the page.

Example:
```
https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20you%20should%20not%20nest%20component%20function%20definitions
```
